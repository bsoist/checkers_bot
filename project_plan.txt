Proposed deadlines:
Quarter 1: All code for checkers game except for the AI whcih will propose the best possible move based on calcluated outcomes.
Quarter 2: The Robot will be completed and operational. Fine tuning of controls will not be completed until the 3rd Quarter. The AI will be typed and in the debugging stages.
Quarter 3: The Robot will be fully operational. The scripting will be fully operational. A game will be effecively played by the robot against a Homosapien.
Quarter 4: Sounds will be added (mockery), and aesthetic improvements will be made to Robot if needed. 
For Extra Credit: The robot will beat Mr. Soistmann at checkers.

Responsibilities:
James and Michael: Build robot, construct Robot() class.
Aaron and Corbin: construct other classes, install proper software on NXT Brick.

Project Summary:
Software: Eight classes will be used: Game(), Board(), Player(), Human(), SimPlayer(), Piece(), Move(), and Robot(). Human and SimPlayer will be subclasses of Player. The AI will be contained within the Player class and will function recursively by applying all possible moves to a board object. Likely, moves that, from the beginning, do not look like opportune moves will not be evaluated as deeply as seemingly opportunistic moves. Value of a specific outcome will be determined mainly by a pieces captured to pieces take ratio (with higher value for kings) and also by forward movement of non-King pieces towards the opposite side of the board.
